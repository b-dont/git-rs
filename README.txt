This is a project I've been thinking about for a bit. I'd like to work on a very *very* light-weight git hosting platform in Rust. So far, this is just the Multithread Web Server project from the last chapter of the Rust Book, but I'm going to expand and refactor it to be an all-in-one web server for git hosting that is self-hostable, fast, and has a CLI to interact with it client-side, similar to the `gh` GitHub CLI, and the `glab` Gitlab CLI.
